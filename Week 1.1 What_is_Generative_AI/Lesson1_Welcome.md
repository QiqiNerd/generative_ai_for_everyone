# Week 1 Lesson 1: Welcome

## 1. Introduction to the Course

Generative AI has captured the attention of individuals, corporations, and governments alike since the release of ChatGPT. It is a **disruptive technology**（颠覆性技术）that is already transforming how people learn and work.

Many developers believe that generative AI will:

- Empower individuals
- Improve productivity
- Contribute to global economic growth

However, there are also concerns, such as:

- Job loss
- Economic displacement

This course aims to offer:

- A clear, **non-technical understanding**（非技术性理解）of generative AI
- Practical knowledge for applying it in different fields (business, science, arts, humanities, etc.)
- Clarification of **misinformation**（错误信息）surrounding the technology

## 2. Economic Impact of Generative AI

Generative AI gained mainstream attention around **November 2022**, with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI.

According to various studies:

- **McKinsey**: GenAI could add **\$2.6 to $4.4 trillion annually** to the global economy.
- **Goldman Sachs**: Predicts a **7% increase in global GDP** over the next decade.
- **OpenAI and UPenn**: 
  - Over **80% of U.S. workers** may see **10% of their tasks** affected by GenAI.
  - For **20% of workers**, more than **50% of their tasks** could be affected.

This duality of **productivity gain**（生产力提升）and **automation-related job loss**（自动化导致的失业）frames much of the current debate.

## 3. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to **artificial intelligence**（人工智能）systems that can **generate high-quality content**（生成高质量内容）, such as:

- Text
- Images
- Audio

### 3.1 Popular Tools

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Bard** (Google)
- **Bing Chat** (Microsoft)

These tools typically use a **prompt**（提示词）entered by users to generate a response.

### 3.2 Developer Tools

Beyond consumer-facing tools, generative AI also plays a transformative role as a **developer tool**（开发工具）. It allows for:

- Easier construction of AI systems
- Lower development costs
- Greater diversity of AI product offerings

### 3.3 AI in Everyday Life

Examples of existing AI in daily use include:

- Web searches (Google, Bing)
- Fraud detection in credit card usage
- Product/movie recommendations (Amazon, Netflix)

Generative AI **lowers the barrier**（降低门槛）to building these types of applications.

## 4. Types of Generative AI Outputs

While text generation is the most common and impactful use case today, generative AI can also produce:

### 4.1 Images

- Generates artwork or **photo-realistic images**（真实感图像）based on prompts

### 4.2 Audio

- Voice cloning, e.g., AI-generated voice of Andrew Ng:  
  _“Hi, I'm an AI-generated voice clone of Andrew. Andrew never actually said these words.”_

### 4.3 Video

- Combining audio and images to create **video clones**（视频克隆）

Example:  
_Hi, I'm a video clone of Andrew, it's nice to meet you._

These capabilities show how **multimodal**（多模态）generative AI is becoming.
