# Week 1 Lesson 3: LLMs as a Thought Partner

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs)（大型语言模型）are now widely accessible through web interfaces such as:

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Bard** (Google)
- **Bing Chat** (Microsoft)

This lesson explores how LLMs can be used in everyday scenarios and offers ideas for integrating them as useful tools in your personal and professional life.

## 2. LLMs for Information Retrieval

LLMs provide a new way to retrieve information by interacting conversationally.

### 2.1 Factual Queries

Example:  
> What’s the capital of South Africa?

An LLM might correctly respond with:
- Pretoria
- Cape Town
- Bloemfontein

However, LLMs can sometimes **hallucinate**（幻觉，生成虚假内容）— that is, make up facts.  
**Best practice**: Cross-check important factual information with **authoritative sources**（权威来源）.

### 2.2 Clarifying Context through Conversation

Example:

- User: What does LLM stand for?  
  → LLM may answer: “Legum Magister” (a law degree)

- User: What about in the context of AI?  
  → Then it may clarify: “Large Language Model”

Lesson: You can guide LLMs by adding **context**（上下文）through back-and-forth conversation.

## 3. LLMs as Writing and Creativity Assistants

### 3.1 Editing Help

Prompt:  
> Rewrite this for clarity: “Since all around the world are realizing learning has happened…”

LLMs are effective at improving grammar, clarity, and readability.

### 3.2 Story Generation

Prompt:  
> Write a 300-word story involving trucks to help encourage brushing teeth.

This can generate entertaining and creative content for children. While it may not match professional storytelling, it works well for **quick and engaging output**（快速有趣的输出）.

## 4. When to Use Web Search vs. LLMs

### 4.1 Healthcare Example

**Sprained ankle**:

- **Web Search**: Authoritative sources like **Mayo Clinic** or **Harvard Health** offer trusted medical advice.
- **LLM**: May provide general guidance but should **not be fully trusted** without verification due to hallucination risk.

**Advice**: For critical information like health, rely on **verified sources**.

### 4.2 Recipe Example

**Pineapple Pie**:

- Web search offers many good, **trusted recipes**（可信赖的食谱）.
- LLMs may create new recipes, but results can be **inconsistent** or **strange**.

### 4.3 Creative Use Case

**Coffee-infused Pineapple Pie**:

- Web search returns nothing useful.
- LLMs can brainstorm and act as a **thought partner**（思维伙伴）to generate ideas from scratch.

Ideal for **esoteric or novel tasks**（冷门或新奇的任务）

## 5. Summary

LLMs can be used for:

- Information retrieval
- Clarifying complex ideas
- Rewriting and editing
- Generating creative content
- Brainstorming novel ideas

**Key Principle**: Use web search for **trusted, factual content** and LLMs for **creative or brainstorming tasks**.

## 6. What’s Next

In the next lesson, we’ll explore:

- Generative AI as a **general-purpose technology**（通用技术）
- A systematic framework for organizing what it can do
- Categories of tasks like **writing**, **reading**, and **chatting**

Let’s continue!
