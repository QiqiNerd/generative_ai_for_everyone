# Week 1 Lesson 4: AI is a General Purpose Technology

## 1. Introduction

What is Generative AI good for? The answer is broad because **AI is a general-purpose technology**（通用技术）. Unlike tools with singular uses (e.g., a car for transportation, a microwave for heating), AI has **many diverse applications**, making it more challenging to describe.

Similar to:

- **Electricity**（电力）
- **The Internet**（互联网）

AI is **pervasive**（无处不在）and **multi-purpose**, making it hard to summarize with a single function.

## 2. Examples of General-Purpose AI Tools

- **Supervised Learning**（监督学习）: used for spam filtering, online ads, speech recognition
- **Generative AI**（生成式人工智能）: used for writing, summarizing, and conversations

These technologies support many tasks, including those shown in the previous video.

## 3. A Framework for LLM Capabilities

LLMs (Large Language Models) are capable of many different types of tasks, which can be broadly categorized as:

- **Writing**
- **Reading**
- **Chatting**

Let’s explore each one.

## 4. Writing Tasks

Generative AI can create content based on prompts.

Examples:

- **Brainstorming product names**
- **Rewriting content for clarity**
- **Answering employee HR questions**, if connected to company-specific data

Writing tasks often begin with a **prompt**（提示词）and lead to creative or informative text outputs.

## 5. Reading Tasks

These involve taking a **longer input** and generating a **shorter output**.

Example:

- An e-commerce business receives many customer emails.
- GenAI can scan the email and decide:
  > Is this a complaint? Yes/No

Example emails:

- "I love my new llama t-shirt, the fabric is so soft." → **Not a complaint**
- "I wore my llama t-shirt to a friend’s wedding and now they’re mad at me." → **Maybe a complaint**

While this task could also be solved with supervised learning, **Generative AI allows faster and cheaper development** of such tools.

## 6. Chatting Tasks

Chatbots powered by Generative AI can:

- Handle general-purpose conversations (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard)
- Perform **specialized tasks**（专用任务）, such as:
  - Taking food delivery orders
  - Guiding users through company workflows

Example:

- User: "I’d like a cheeseburger for delivery"
- Chatbot: "Got it! Your cheeseburger is on the way"

## 7. Two Types of LLM Applications

### 7.1 Web Interface-based Applications

These are accessible via websites and useful for:

- Brainstorming
- Answering general questions

Examples: ChatGPT, Bard, Bing Chat

### 7.2 Software-based LLM Applications

These are embedded in internal systems and workflows.

Examples:

- Automatically routing customer complaint emails
- Answering HR questions based on private company policies

They are integrated into **larger automation systems**（更大规模的软件自动化系统） and are not user-facing in the traditional web sense.

## 8. Summary

Generative AI is flexible, powerful, and difficult to pin down to a single use. It helps with:

- Writing: Generating or refining content
- Reading: Summarizing or classifying long inputs
- Chatting: Carrying on general or task-specific dialogues

These use cases can be deployed via:

- **Web Interfaces**
- **Software Systems**

## 9. What’s Next

In the next videos, we’ll take a deeper dive into:

- Writing tasks
- Reading tasks
- Chatting tasks

Each category offers valuable opportunities for applying Generative AI in real-world scenarios.
