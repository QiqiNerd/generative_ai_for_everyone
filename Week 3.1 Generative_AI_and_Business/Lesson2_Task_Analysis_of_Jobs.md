# Lesson 2: Task analysis of jobs

## 1. Overview

Many businesses—large or small—employ people who perform a variety of **tasks（任务）**. A useful framework from economics, developed by **Erik Brynjolfsson**, **Tom Mitchell**, and **Daniel Rock**, helps analyze whether tasks within jobs can be **automated（自动化）** or **augmented（增强）** using AI. This framework is practical not just for economists, but for businesses seeking real opportunities to implement **generative AI（生成式人工智能）**.

## 2. AI Does Not Automate Jobs, It Automates Tasks

While the media often debates whether AI will "take jobs," from a technical and business perspective it's more accurate to say: **AI automates tasks, not entire jobs.**

### 2.1 Example: Customer Service Representative

Typical **tasks（任务）** might include:
- Answering phone calls
- Responding to chat queries
- Checking customer order status
- Keeping records of interactions
- Assessing the validity of customer complaints

### 2.2 Analyzing Automation Potential

Each task can be evaluated for its **potential to be automated or augmented**:

| Task | Potential |
|------|-----------|
| Answering phone calls | Low |
| Responding to chat | High |
| Checking order status | Medium |
| Keeping records | High |
| Assessing complaints | Low |

*These values are hypothetical and will vary depending on your specific organization.*

## 3. Augmentation vs Automation

### 3.1 Augmentation（增强）

Using AI to **help** humans with tasks.  
**Example:** AI drafts a customer reply for a human to review.

### 3.2 Automation（自动化）

Using AI to **fully perform** a task.  
**Example:** Automatically summarizing customer interactions.

Most businesses **start with augmentation** to maintain human oversight, and **move gradually** to full automation as trust in the system grows.

## 4. Evaluating AI Potential

Two key factors for assessing AI's usefulness for a task:

### 4.1 Technical Feasibility（技术可行性）

Ask: **Can AI do it?** And if yes, **how expensive is it to build**?

A rule of thumb:  
> Can a fresh college graduate, following the prompt instructions, complete the task?

If unsure, experiment using an LLM (e.g., GPT) with sample prompts. AI engineers can help evaluate whether techniques like:
- **RAG（检索增强生成）**
- **Fine-tuning（微调）**

...are appropriate and what their complexity/cost would be.

### 4.2 Business Value（商业价值）

Ask:
- How much **time** is spent on this task?
- Will doing it **faster, cheaper, or more consistently** create value?

Note: automation can lead to more than cost savings—it can **transform workflows**.

## 5. Using Occupation Databases (e.g., O\*NET)

The **O\*NET** database (funded by the US government) helps break down job roles into tasks.

Example: For "Customer Service Representative," it includes tasks such as:
- Confirm customer details by phone or in person
- Keep records of interactions

**Caution:** O\*NET is general and **may not match your company exactly**. Use it for ideas, not as a strict rulebook.

## 6. Summary

- Break down job roles into tasks.
- Analyze each task for **technical feasibility** and **business value**.
- Use augmentation first, then potentially move to automation.
- Explore external tools like **O\*NET** to get ideas on tasks per role.

In the next lesson, we’ll explore **other job roles** and how this framework can be applied to them.
