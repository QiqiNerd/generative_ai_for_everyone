# Lesson 1: Day-to-day usage of web UI LLMs

## 1. Introduction

In this lesson, we explore how individuals across various job roles are already using large language models (LLMs, 大型语言模型) in their daily workflows through web-based user interfaces (web UI, 网页用户界面). We also introduce the upcoming framework for analyzing businesses to identify opportunities where generative AI (生成式人工智能) can augment or automate tasks.

## 2. Common Use Cases in Daily Work

### 2.1 Writing Assistant

LLMs can act as effective writing assistants or copy editors. For example:
- **Prompt**: Rewrite this piece of text to be suitable for a professional business report.
- **Output**: LLMs typically do a decent job, although their suggestions should be reviewed by humans before use.

LLMs are used for:
- Improving writing tone and clarity.
- Editing for grammar and professional style.
- Generating drafts quickly.

### 2.2 Marketing Support

Marketers are using LLMs for brainstorming and campaign ideation:
- **Prompt**: Help me brainstorm an email campaign to reactivate lost users.
- **Output**: LLM might generate campaign suggestions such as "We miss you" emails, discount offers, or newsletter updates.

LLMs can continue conversations and generate more detailed campaign ideas upon follow-up prompts.

### 2.3 Recruitment and HR

Recruiters use LLMs to summarize candidate reviews:
- **Prompt**: Summarize the final review of a job candidate in 50 or fewer words.
- **Output**: Generally concise and useful summaries, but again, human validation is recommended.

LLMs assist in speeding up text processing tasks in recruitment workflows.

### 2.4 Software Engineering

LLMs can help software developers by generating:
- Boilerplate code.
- Function templates.
- Explanatory comments.

**Example**: Write Python code to calculate the standard deviation.

LLMs can be:
- Helpful in starting a coding task.
- Often buggy, requiring review and correction.

## 3. LLMs as Thought Partners

LLMs are increasingly used as thought partners (思维伙伴) to:
- Generate ideas.
- Offer alternative perspectives.
- Break mental blocks during planning or problem solving.

Many users, including Andrew Ng, note that LLMs are not perfect, but still useful for generating initial drafts or thinking structures.

## 4. Preview of Next Topic

The next lesson introduces a **systematic framework** for identifying high-value opportunities to implement generative AI in businesses. It involves:
- Analyzing tasks and job roles.
- Considering where AI can augment or automate workflows.
- Assessing feasibility and value of building or buying LLM-powered software.

Stay tuned as we dive into practical methodologies for business impact analysis with generative AI.
