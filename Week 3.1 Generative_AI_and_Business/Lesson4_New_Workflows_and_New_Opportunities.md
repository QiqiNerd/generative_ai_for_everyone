# Lesson 4: New workflows and new opportunities

## 1. Introduction

Generative AI is not only contributing to **cost savings (节省成本)**, but also opening up pathways to **revenue growth (收入增长)**. In this lesson, we’ll explore how **new workflows (新的工作流程)** and redesigning operations around AI can lead to greater efficiency, innovation, and entirely new opportunities.

## 2. Example 1: Surgeon with research assistance

### 2.1 Traditional workflow

A **surgeon (外科医生)** typically:
- Spends significant time researching a **medical procedure (医疗程序)** for a specific patient case
- Then enters the **operating theater (手术室)** to perform surgery

### 2.2 With generative AI

If the surgeon uses **retrieval augmented generation (RAG, 检索增强生成)** tools:
- The research phase becomes faster and more efficient
- The surgery itself remains unchanged, as it's still a manual procedure

**Implication:** AI augments the information preparation stage, reducing cognitive workload before critical decision-making.

## 3. Example 2: Lawyer reviewing a complex legal document

### 3.1 Traditional workflow

A **lawyer (律师)** must:
- Gather detailed info from the client
- Carefully review complex contracts
- Meet the client again for feedback

### 3.2 With generative AI

- Gathering client info remains unchanged
- AI helps summarize and extract key points from long documents
- Lawyer still delivers final analysis, possibly more efficiently

This is an example of **partial automation (部分自动化)**, where repetitive reading can be shortened while still requiring human legal judgment.

## 4. Example 3: Lawyer reviewing simple documents

### 4.1 Without AI

For **simple documents** like NDAs (non-disclosure agreements, 保密协议):
- Less information gathering
- Fast review by the lawyer
- Simple feedback provided to the client

### 4.2 With AI

- AI quickly analyzes the NDA
- Lawyer reviews a summary or flagged items
- Adds a **human verification step (人工核查步骤)** for safety
- Final feedback is faster and more focused

## 5. Example 4: Marketer writing website copy

### 5.1 Traditional process

A **marketer (市场营销人员)**:
- Spends a long time drafting website text (copy)
- Pushes it to the website for public viewing

### 5.2 AI-enhanced process

- AI helps write **website copy (网站文案)**
- Once efficient, this leads to **A/B testing (A/B测试)**:
  - Multiple variations of website copy can be created and deployed
  - Marketer gathers performance data (e.g., click rate, conversion)
  - Refines prompts based on performance

This is an example of using generative AI for **iterative improvement (迭代改进)** rather than just speed.

## 6. Rethinking workflows

AI's efficiency allows companies to **redesign workflows (重新设计工作流程)**:
- Add steps like verification
- Automate low-risk tasks
- Focus human effort where it matters most

This often leads to not only cost savings, but **productivity gains (生产力提升)** and innovation.

## 7. Analyzing Customer Tasks

### 7.1 Not just employee tasks

Most companies focus only on improving their internal processes. But another valuable angle is to analyze the **tasks your customers (客户任务)** are performing when interacting with your product or service.

### 7.2 Example: Website builder

If you provide a tool to help users build websites:
- Customer tasks might include choosing a design, writing titles, adding images, optimizing for search engines (SEO, 搜索引擎优化)

By analyzing where generative AI could assist—like writing SEO-friendly titles—you can develop features that **directly improve the user experience (提升用户体验)**.

## 8. Summary

Generative AI creates opportunities not just by reducing costs, but also by enabling:
- **New services**
- **More efficient workflows**
- **Improved customer products**

Two frameworks for brainstorming:
1. Tasks performed by **employees**
2. Tasks performed by **customers**

Both can help uncover valuable AI use cases to grow your business.
