# Lesson 5: Teams to Build Generative AI Software

## 1. Common Team Roles for Building Generative AI Applications

### 1.1 Software Engineer（软件工程师）
- Responsible for writing the software application and ensuring it runs robustly.
- With basic knowledge of large language models (LLMs, 大语言模型) and prompting（提示词编写）, software engineers can be very effective in small teams.
- Recommendation: Encourage software engineers to learn the basics of LLMs and prompting.

### 1.2 Machine Learning Engineer（机器学习工程师）
- Typically responsible for implementing the AI system.
- Many have prior experience with AI before the rise of generative AI.
- Especially effective if they learn advanced LLM techniques such as:
  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation, 检索增强生成)
  - Fine-tuning（微调）

### 1.3 Product Manager（产品经理）
- Responsible for identifying and scoping the project.
- Ensures that the built product is useful for customers.
- Less common than engineers but still valuable in some teams.

### 1.4 Prompt Engineer（提示词工程师）
- Media hype suggests high demand and salary, but reality differs.
- Few companies hire dedicated prompt engineers.
- Most prompt engineering roles resemble ML engineers who have learned prompting.
- Insight: Prompt engineering alone is not a scalable or high-demand full-time role.

## 2. Team Sizes and Configurations

### 2.1 One-Person Teams
- Common for early prototyping.
- Example: 
  - A software engineer who has learned prompting.
  - A machine learning engineer testing ideas via web interfaces.

### 2.2 Two-Person Teams
- Common pairing:
  - Machine Learning Engineer + Software Engineer
- Other effective configurations:
  - Software Engineer + Product Manager
  - Two tech-savvy individuals learning LLM tools together.

## 3. Other Potential Roles in Larger Teams

### 3.1 Data Engineer（数据工程师）
- Organizes and ensures the quality and security of data.

### 3.2 Data Scientist（数据科学家）
- Analyzes data and provides business or project recommendations.

### 3.3 Project Manager（项目经理）
- Coordinates project execution.

### 3.4 Machine Learning Researcher（机器学习研究员）
- Develops or adapts cutting-edge AI technologies to suit the company’s needs.

## 4. Conclusion

Generative AI (生成式人工智能) lowers both the **cost** and **barriers to entry** for building AI-powered applications. Even small teams—or individuals—can start prototyping and developing solutions with relatively minimal resources.

If you have an idea, consider experimenting and building something for yourself or your organization.

In the next lesson, we’ll analyze how AI is affecting job roles and industries.
