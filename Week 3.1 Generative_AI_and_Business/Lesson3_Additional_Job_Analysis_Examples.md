# Lesson 3: ADDITIONAL JOB ANALYSIS EXAMPLES

## 1. Introduction

In many job roles, people tend to associate a single iconic task with a profession — for instance, **computer programmers** write code, **doctors** see patients, and **lawyers** argue in court. When thinking about AI's potential, the instinct is often to ask whether AI can do *that one* iconic task (标志性任务).

However, a **systematic analysis of job tasks** can reveal surprising insights. The best opportunities for using generative AI may not be the obvious ones.

## 2. Example: Computer Programmers

### 2.1 Task Breakdown

- Write code
- Write documentation
- Respond to user support
- Review others' code
- Gather software requirements

### 2.2 Generative AI Potential

While **code writing** might seem like the best fit for AI, it's actually quite difficult for LLMs (大语言模型) to generate consistently functional code. On the other hand, **documentation writing** is a more feasible task for generative AI (生成式人工智能). Responding to support queries and reviewing code also have medium potential.

> Note: These are informal estimates. Actual evaluation should be based on **technical feasibility** (技术可行性) and **business value** (商业价值).

## 3. Example: Lawyers

### 3.1 Task Breakdown

- Draft and review legal documents
- Interpret laws and answer client queries
- Review evidence
- Negotiate settlements
- Represent clients in court

### 3.2 Generative AI Potential

High potential:
- Drafting and reviewing legal documents
- Answering basic legal questions

Low potential:
- Representing clients in court

AI is unlikely to **fully automate court representation** soon, but many **text-heavy, repetitive legal tasks** can be efficiently augmented or automated.

## 4. Example: Landscapers (园艺师)

### 4.1 Task Breakdown

- Maintain and care for plants
- Transport and purchase plants
- Maintain equipment
- Communicate with clients
- Maintain a website

### 4.2 Generative AI Potential

Most of these tasks are **physical or manual**, giving them **low potential** for generative AI automation. Exceptions may include:
- Website maintenance
- Scheduling or client communication (to some extent)

Overall, landscaping jobs are **less affected** by generative AI than legal or programming roles.

## 5. Reflection: Where Should AI Be Applied?

Rather than chasing iconic tasks, businesses should:
- Break down job roles into **individual tasks**
- Assess each task’s **AI suitability** based on feasibility and value
- Focus on augmentation first and then explore automation

## 6. Beyond Cost Savings: Unlocking Growth

While **cost savings** is often the initial motivator for automation, truly transformative innovations often enable **revenue growth (收入增长)**.

- Technologies like steam engines, electricity, and computers started as cost-saving tools, but later **reshaped industries**.
- Example: Automating customer queries 1,000 times cheaper → opportunity to serve customers **1,000 times better**, not just cheaper.

### 6.1 Growth Mindset

Instead of merely cutting costs:
- Use generative AI to **reimagine workflows (重新定义工作流)**
- Create **new forms of value** and **expand business opportunities**

## 7. Preview of Next Lesson

The next video will examine specific case studies where businesses rethought workflows and created **growth**, not just savings, through generative AI.
