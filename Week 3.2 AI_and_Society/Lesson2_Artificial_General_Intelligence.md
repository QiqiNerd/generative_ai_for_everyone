# Lesson 2. Artificial General Intelligence

# 2.1 What Is AGI?

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI, 通用人工智能)** refers to an AI system that can perform *any* intellectual task that a human can. This is different from:

- **Narrow AI (狭义人工智能)**: AI designed for specific tasks (e.g., chess playing, facial recognition).
- **General-purpose technology (通用技术)**: A technology usable in many fields—like electricity or the internet—but not necessarily intelligent across all human tasks.

While tools like ChatGPT feel like general-purpose tools due to their versatility, they are not AGI. They are still specialized in language-based tasks and lack full human-like cognitive abilities.

# 2.2 Key Capabilities of AGI

For an AI to qualify as AGI, it would need to match or exceed human capability in **any intellectual domain**, including:

- **Learning new tasks with limited data**: For example, learning to drive with 20 hours of practice—similar to a teenager. (As noted by deep learning pioneer Ilya Sutskever, current AI systems require orders of magnitude more data and tuning.)
- **Completing advanced research**: AGI would be capable of completing a PhD-level thesis after several years of work. While today's AI tools assist in brainstorming and organizing content, they cannot autonomously conduct and synthesize complex academic research.
- **Performing knowledge work**: AGI would be able to take over the full range of intellectual tasks carried out by knowledge workers such as:
  - Computer programmers
  - Lawyers
  - Scientists
  - Managers
  - Teachers

# 2.3 How Far Are We from AGI?

Estimates vary significantly:

- **Conservative View**: Many experts believe AGI is still **decades away** due to the massive technical challenges involved.
- **Optimistic View**: Some companies claim we are closer, but often redefine AGI with a *lower bar*. Andrew Ng recounts a story of an economist friend who joked: “If that’s your definition of AGI, we reached it 30 years ago!”

Reducing the benchmark dilutes the original meaning. For the **widely accepted definition**, AGI remains a distant milestone.

# 2.4 Comparing Human and Artificial Intelligence

AI and biological intelligence (生物智能) are evolving along **different paths**:

- **AI Strengths**:
  - Processing massive amounts of data
  - Mathematical reasoning
  - Pattern recognition at scale

- **Human Strengths**:
  - Common sense reasoning
  - Empathy and moral judgment
  - Physical interaction and sensorimotor skills

AI models can now outperform humans in narrow tasks (e.g., playing Go, analyzing legal documents), but replicating the full **spectrum of human intellect** is an enormous challenge.

# 2.5 The Path to AGI

Creating AGI is not ruled out by physics—there is no known natural law that makes AGI impossible. However, **significant technical breakthroughs** are still required:

- Improvements in **general reasoning** (推理能力)
- More effective **few-shot (小样本学习) or zero-shot (零样本学习) learning**
- Advances in **memory, attention, and planning**
- Integration of **cross-domain knowledge**

Some researchers see the current wave of **Large Language Models (LLMs, 大型语言模型)** as an early sketch of AGI—a rough prototype that demonstrates what’s possible, but not yet close to the goal.

# 2.6 Why AGI Still Matters (Even If We're Not There Yet)

Even though we haven’t achieved AGI, the **capabilities of current AI are already transformative**. They:

- Influence jobs, education, healthcare, and communication
- Can assist in high-level cognitive tasks
- Are evolving at an exponential pace

But with great power comes great responsibility. In the next lesson, we will explore **Responsible AI (负责任的人工智能)** and how we can ensure this powerful tool is used ethically and safely.
