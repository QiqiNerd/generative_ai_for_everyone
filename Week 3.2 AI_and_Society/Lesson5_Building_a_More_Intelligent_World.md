# Lesson 5. Building a More Intelligent World

# 5.1 A Vision for AI

Congratulations on reaching the final video of this course. In this closing message, Andrew Ng presents his vision for how **Artificial Intelligence (人工智能)** can help humanity build a **more intelligent world**—one where intelligence is abundant, affordable, and impactful.

# 5.2 The Value of Intelligence

**Intelligence** is defined here as the ability to apply knowledge and skills to make good decisions. Humanity invests massive resources—years of education and trillions of dollars—into cultivating human intelligence.

### The Cost of Human Intelligence:
- Feeding, educating, and training humans is expensive.
- Only wealthy individuals or institutions can afford to "hire" large amounts of intelligence.
  - For example:
    - A **specialist doctor（专家医生）**
    - A **personal tutor（私人教师）**

# 5.3 The Promise of AI

Unlike human intelligence, **Artificial Intelligence can scale cheaply**.

### What AI Enables:
- Anyone can afford to "hire" intelligence at low cost.
- You no longer need to worry about:
  - High medical bills for expert consultations
  - Expensive educational resources
- AI offers the possibility of building:
  - **An army of intelligent assistants（智能助手）**
  - **Smarter decision-making for individuals and society**

AI could also help tackle **global challenges** such as:
- Climate change（气候变化）
- Pandemics（大流行病）
- Education and poverty

# 5.4 AI as the New Electricity

Andrew Ng famously compares AI to **electricity（电力）**—a transformative force that touches every industry and aspect of life.

### Historical Parallel:
- When electricity was new, it sparked fear: electrocution, fire hazards, etc.
- Despite its risks, electricity has become indispensable (light, heat, communication, refrigeration).

### Today:
- AI still has flaws and risks.
- But **Generative AI（生成式人工智能）** is a major leap forward in how much intelligence we can scale and distribute.
- Over time, as the technology matures:
  - **Use cases will expand**
  - **Technology will become safer**
  - **Today's fears will subside**

# 5.5 Long-Term Benefits

If used responsibly, AI has the potential to contribute to:
- **Longer lives（更长寿）**
- **Healthier societies（更健康的社会）**
- **More fulfilling lives（更有意义的生活）**

AI will not solve everything, but it can be part of the **collective intelligence** humanity needs to address the world's greatest problems.

# 5.6 Final Words

Thank you for taking this course. As you move forward:

- Use **Generative AI** responsibly and creatively.
- Help others understand and apply this technology.
- Contribute to building a world where intelligence—human and artificial—is used to serve all.

Together, we can help shape a future that is not only more intelligent, but also more just, inclusive, and humane.
